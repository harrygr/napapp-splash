# Napapp Splash Page

The splash page for Nap.

It's a simple html file with some assets (styles, images).

You can just copy the files onto your webserver and serve it up.

Styles are compiled from the scss file so you'll need to recompile it if you make changes. There is a gulpfile included to do this. Just run `npm install` to install dependencies and then `gulp styles` each time you make a change and you're good to go!
